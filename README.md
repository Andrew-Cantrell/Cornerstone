# Cornerstone

This is the first test project - mistakes will be made

python download: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/
>>> use the windows x86 web installer download with the standard install configuration

python editor download: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC
>>> make sure you select 64-bit launcher, create associations, and download JRE x86 (java runtime environment) 
>>> select the default folder

1. when you launch the editor select a scheme and color 
>>> I used Darcula in the first and Twilight in the second setting 
2. Once you've launched the editor do the following
>>> select file on the toolbar
>>> select open new scratch file
>>> select save-as and then choose a save-as name

To Dos: 
1. Add one new functionality per week and write sample code that showcases that functionality
2. Save each new functionality as a .py file and name the file for that functionality
3. Create usable library of code to deploy for more complex functionality.
